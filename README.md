# Space Capitalism

This is a game wherein the player is an interplanetary trader.
They will go from system to system,  planet to planet, perhaps
even galaxy to galaxy, and buy and sell goods wherever they go.

At each planet, they will have to secure the rights to trade and
make port. Some planets may be cooperative, while others may be resistant.
